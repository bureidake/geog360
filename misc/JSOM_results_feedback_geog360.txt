Please open attachment for feedback.

I recommend coming to the writing workshop for an opportunity to resubmit for re-grading after some instruction to help you with this type of writing.

Overall Feedback:
Critical review revisions. If you attended the writing workshop and resubmitted a revised paper, your new grades are now posted. Everyone earned an additional 2 points for attending the workshop and resubmitting. If you made substantial improvements, you received additional points.


Students are invited to attend the Writing Workshop on Wednesday, Oct 23 for instruction on how to improve Critical Review papers. If you attend, you may revise your CR paper for re-grading based on my comments and the instruction you receive during the workshop. You must attend the writing workshop to be eligible to revise and resubmit your CR paper. If you don't attend and resubmit, you will receive the current grade assigned.

Please bring a printout of your paper with my comments on it to class.

Feedback on CR papers includes the following:

Blue highlighting = thesis statement or information that could be developed as a thesis statement

Dark pink (fuchsia) highlighting = examples of evidence used to support thesis. Provide or strengthen this type of evidence in your rewrites.

Yellow highlighting = writing problem of some sort – sentence structure, grammar, capitalization, punctuation, word choice, etc. These examples are not exhaustive so you should look for similar issues throughout your paper that need to be corrected.

Red = accuracy problem; facts from article are incorrect

Green = awkward phrasing or word choice in need of revision for clarity

Gray = Unnecessary sentence. This type of sentence does not need to be included in your paper.

All students will have comment bubbles in the margins with written feedback too.

Jimmy,

Q1.While it may be difficult to define in one sentence, I’d like you to try. I think you can based on elements of your answer. Good logic in describing the human part and the geographic part.

Human Geography is the study of the “interaction between humans and the environment around them” and the spaces that result from human interaction.” One sentence using your words. For your example, link a geographic concept like spatial diffusion or migration more explicitly to your example of studying the settlement patterns of the US (rubric point 4). Try to be more concise to improve on pt 6.

26/30

Q2. Good on rubric point 2. I think you are misinterpreting what we mean by qualitative data in this answer. Empirical research can collect and analyze either quantitative or qualitative data.

Your answer also need to discuss the components of an empirical research article 3-7. For 1, good to include the importance of actual observation but also state that ER reports on original research conducted by the author. For example, your answer describes the methods used in the Rose-Redwood and Kadonaga article, but you need to explain that an ER article includes a methods section that describes how they collected and analyzed the data. 15/20

Jimy,

Good defining of feminism and feminist geography. However, the grammar and sentence structure could use improvements. Refrain from using et cetera  in exam answers and be precise in what you want to suggest.

Nice linking of the examples from the article to concepts of gender division of labor and gendered spaces.

Content is strong, writing mechanics are keeping you from earning A's. I suggest getting assistance from the Writing Center before handing in your next essay.

Overall Feedback:
Advice on how to answer this type of exam question effectively. Please apply these comments to answering your final exam question because it is similar.

Question: Explain how and why the article fits into at least one of the subareas of human geography (cultural, feminist, urban, political, etc).

Steps for answering:

Review the general definitions of human geography and the subareas (cultural, feminist, population, urban, etc). Figure out how the themes in the definition of human geography and the subarea are present in the research article.
 

Identify several concepts from human geography and/or one of its subareas that are important to this research
 

(e.g., space, place, distribution, spatial association, relocation diffusion, cultural landscape, in place/out of place, territoriality, urbanization, gendered space, migration theory (push/pull factors), geodemographics, spatial segregation, etc).

 

3.   Explain the connections between the general definitions in #1 and concepts in #2 above to specific examples from the research described in the article. Do this to make your case as to why this research is an example of human geography.

KEY COMPONENT: Make sure your answer has a thesis statement in the first paragraph of your answer, near or at the end of the first paragraph.

Your thesis statement will be something like

This research on [add summary of subject] is an example of human and [add subarea] geography because … [reason 1], [reason 2], and [reason 3].  

Here is an example:

Fletchall's research on microbrews in Montana is a great example of a cultural geographic study because it links cultural practices of beer drinking to a specific place, connects New West identity and location, and describes the role of placemaking and neolocalism in the microbrewery and tourist industries of Montana.

Why is the thesis above a strong thesis? Because it states three ways in which the research in this article represent the themes of cultural geography.

I would expect the rest of your essay to provide evidence and examples that show 1) how beer drinking is a cultural practice connected to place characteristics, specifically names and imagery of beers, meeting locals, and learning the history of and sense of place, 2) how cultural identity of outdoor activities, fishing, mountain landscapes is connected to Montana and 3) how tourist and microbrewery industries employ neolocalism and placemaking to promote their industries, being sure to define these concepts and explain how they are used by the microbreweries. 

Other types of sentences that help you to make connections between the themes and concepts of importance in cultural geography to the specific examples from the article itself.

Provide a general definition.

Cultural geography is …

Placemaking is [add general definition] and it is an important concept in this article because the research shows [include a specific example from the article].

Two concepts of important to this approach to research are sense of place and belonging in-place. [Then define the terms].  

 

Additional explanation:

In order to be an example of population geography, the study described in the article doesn't need to address all types of population geography or concepts of important in population geography – e.g. life expectancy, infant mortality, population pyramids, geodemography, migration, and migration decision theory. It just needs to make a case for why the themes covered in the article fit into the category of population geography.

Example of what you might write:

This article focuses on migration patterns to and away from rural areas. The focus on rural areas indicates that location, a focus of human geography, is key to this research. The push and pull factors are thoroughly examined by the authors. Migration decision theory, which explains the reasons for leaving (push) and for migrating to a place (pull), is a key theory in population geography. The push and pull factors are thoroughly examined by the authors. For example, return migration was likely to occur for employment opportunities, family ties, and community characteristics.
