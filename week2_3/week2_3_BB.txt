Description
Using the information in the "Readings due" section of the weekly schedule, search for and access the course readings through the CSULB library page.

Remember that the way to tell the difference between an article in an academic journal and a chapter in a book, is that an article will have the title of the article, the name of the journal that contains it, followed by a volume and issue number. Each of the readings marked CR (CR1, CR2, CR3, and CR4) is an example of an article in an academic journal.

A chapter in a book will include a city of publication and the name of a publisher such as "National Academy Press."
